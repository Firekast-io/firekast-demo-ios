# Hello Firekast ðŸš€

This simple **iOS app** demonstrates how easy to use is the Firekast iOS SDK.

1. Git clone this project
2. Run `pod install`
3. Modify `AppDelegate.swift` with your credentials. *Visit our [dashboard](https://dashboard.firekast.io/) if you don't have yet.*
4. Run the code on your favorite mobile device

Within the app,  make a live stream in the first tab (the longer the better ðŸ˜Ž). When you are done watch your live in the second tab. Note, the player is able to play either live or VOD, it automagically figures it out.

Happy live stream!  ðŸŽ¥

4. Click the "Hello world!" tab to watch your live. On the following screenshot the stream is BAD because I made the stream in bad network condition for the test :)

### Troubleshootings

- The following error is because you did not activate Youtube Data API v3 in the Google API Console. You will need to logout and sign-in again to re-new your token.

`Firekast start stream error: Youtube error: Access Not Configured. YouTube Data API has not been used in project 796*****765 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview?project=796*****765 then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry. (code: 4)`
