# Hello Firekast ðŸš€

This simple **iOS app** demonstrates how easy to use is the Firekast iOS SDK.

1. Git clone this project
2. Run `pod install`
3. Modify `AppDelegate.swift` with your credentials. *Visit our dashboard if you don't have yet.*
4. Run the code on your favorite mobile device

Within the app,  make a live stream in the first tab (the longer the better ðŸ˜Ž). When you are done watch your live in the second tab. Note, the player is able to play either live or VOD, it automagically figures it out.

Happy live stream!  ðŸŽ¥
